# CSE15L Servers and Bugs
### **1. Creating StringServer**

* First, I had to create a web server called StringServer that uses the domain to add strings to our StringServer. 

* The StringServer is supposed to work when a user uses the command `/add-message?s=<string>`

* This command adds the user-inputted string to our server and prints out the stored strings with each on a new line. 

* Here is the completed source code for this project:
